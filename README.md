# Shortest Route

Shortest Route is a mini-program that reads in a maze and solves it in the fewest amount of steps.  

## IMPORTANT

This version of Shortest Route includes some starter-code provided by Utah State University computer science department to which I give credit. Major functionality/displayment code is my own work. 

## Running Shortest Route

Run main.cpp using Algernoon.cpp and Algernoon.h with prefered C++ IDE. The maze text files are included to test algorithm with mazes that vary in difficulty. These should be included in project folder. Program asks which maze is to be solved. Enter file name including its extension.

## Built With

* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) - C++ IDE used.


## Authors

* **Utah State University** - *starter-code*
* **Ross Allen** - *Major functionality/displayment code*

## Acknowledgments

Again, some starter-code was provided by Utah State Universities CS department for the purpose of this assignment.
